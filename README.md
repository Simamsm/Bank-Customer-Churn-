# Credit Card Users Churn Prediction

---
## Problem Statement
There has been a decline in the number of credit card users of a bank. A high portion of the revenue of the bank comes from these customers. It includes annual fees, cash advance fees, interest charges, foreign transaction fees and others. Seeing a decline in the number of users mean a sharp decline in the revenue of the bank.<br><br>
In this project, we are going to:<br>
- Explore the data and find the main variables contributing to the customer churn in this bank.
- Build a machine learning model that can predict if a customer is likely to leave.
- Tree baed models and Deep Learning will be used
